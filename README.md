# OOP Messing in TypeScript

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, but with the elegance and type safety of TypeScript. This project is a collection of my experimental code, written when I find some spare time and want to dive deeper into OOP concepts.

## Project Overview

This repository is a work in progress and may include:

- **Front-end components**: Various user interfaces built using modern frameworks.
- **Back-end components**: Server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Bots**: Automated scripts and bots for different purposes.
- **Miscellaneous**: Other interesting code snippets and projects I decided to explore.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to practice and showcase my skills in OOP using TypeScript. While it might not be rocket science or fully completed projects, it serves as a playground for learning and experimentation.

## Highlights

- Written in TypeScript for better type safety and development experience.
- Emphasis on OOP principles and design patterns.
- Includes both front-end and back-end examples.
- Bots and automation scripts.
- Cross-language projects and snippets.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the code, use it for your own learning, or contribute if you find something interesting. Keep in mind that this is an ongoing project, so you might encounter incomplete features or simple implementations.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions and feedback. If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or want to add something new, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
